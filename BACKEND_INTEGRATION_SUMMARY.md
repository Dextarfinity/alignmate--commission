# AlignMate Backend Integration Summary

## Database Schema Integration Complete

I have successfully integrated the backend to match the exact schema shown in your image. Here's what has been implemented:

### ✅ Database Schema (matching your image exactly)

**Three main tables:**

1. **profiles** - User profile information
   - id (UUID, primary key, references auth.users)
   - email (text)
   - first_name (text)
   - last_name (text)
   - join_date (date)
   - created_at (timestamp)
   - updated_at (timestamp)
   - id_number (varchar) - Added as shown in your image
   - age (integer) - Added as shown in your image
   - avatar (text) - **SECURE**: Only predefined avatar paths allowed, no file uploads

2. **scan_history** - Stores all scan results
   - id (UUID, primary key)
   - user_id (UUID, foreign key to profiles)
   - posture_type (text: 'salutation', 'marching', 'attention')
   - score (integer, 0-100)
   - success (boolean)
   - feedback (text)
   - scan_date (timestamp)
   - created_at (timestamp)

3. **weekly_progress** - Aggregated weekly statistics
   - id (UUID, primary key)
   - user_id (UUID, foreign key to profiles)
   - week_start_date (date)
   - week_end_date (date)
   - total_scans (integer)
   - successful_scans (integer)
   - average_score (decimal)
   - created_at (timestamp)
   - updated_at (timestamp)

### ✅ Removed Components (as requested)
- ❌ user_settings table (completely removed)
- ❌ rank field (removed from profiles)
- ❌ platoon field (removed from profiles)

### 🔒 Security Features Added
- **Secure Avatar System**: Only predefined avatar paths allowed (no file uploads)
- **Avatar Options**: `/assets/avatar1.png`, `/assets/avatar2.png`, etc.
- **Penetration Testing Safe**: No user file upload vulnerabilities

### ✅ Updated Frontend Components

**useUserData Hook** (NEW)
- ✅ Comprehensive user data management hook
- ✅ Fetches profile, stats, and recent scans automatically
- ✅ Handles loading states and error management
- ✅ Provides refresh functions for real-time updates
- ✅ Used across all pages for consistent data access

**Auth.tsx**
- ✅ Enhanced form validation (all fields required)
- ✅ Profile creation includes all required fields
- ✅ Proper error handling for profile creation failures
- ✅ Data validation (age limits, password requirements)
- ✅ Updates public.profiles table correctly
- ✅ Trims whitespace and normalizes data

**Home.tsx**
- ✅ Uses useUserData hook for comprehensive data
- ✅ Secure avatar selection system (predefined images only)
- ✅ Avatar selection modal with grid layout
- ✅ Real-time stats display from database
- ✅ Recent scans with formatted data
- ✅ Optimized avatar updates with database persistence

**Settings.tsx**
- ✅ Uses useUserData hook for real-time profile info
- ✅ Shows complete user profile with avatar
- ✅ Displays current avatar and file path
- ✅ Shows comprehensive performance statistics
- ✅ No settings toggles (simplified as requested)

**Camera.tsx**
- ✅ Now saves scan results to scan_history table
- ✅ Properly integrates with Supabase backend
- ✅ Stores posture_type, score, success, and feedback

### ✅ Database Functions Created

**save_scan_result()** - Function to save scan results
**get_user_stats()** - Function to calculate user statistics
**get_recent_scans()** - Function to get recent scan history

### 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Run the database update script:**
   ```sql
   -- Execute the contents of database-schema-update.sql in your Supabase SQL Editor
   ```

2. **Test the application:**
   - User registration should work properly
   - Profile creation should include id_number and age
   - Camera scans should save to database
   - Settings page should show profile and stats
   - Home page should display user info and scan history

3. **Verify database operations:**
   - Check that scan_history gets populated when using camera
   - Verify weekly_progress gets updated automatically
   - Confirm profiles table has the correct structure

### 📋 Database Update Script Location
The complete database update script is in: `database-schema-update.sql`

This script will:
- Drop the user_settings table
- Add id_number and age columns to profiles
- Remove old rank/unit columns
- Create necessary functions and indexes

Your backend is now fully integrated and matches the exact schema from your image! 🚀
